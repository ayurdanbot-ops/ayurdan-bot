AYURVEDIC KNOWLEDGE: REJUVENATION (Rasayana)
- Root Cause: Depletion of Ojas (vital energy) and aging of body tissues (Dhatus) due to stress, improper lifestyle, and lack of nourishment.
- Treatment Approach: Focuses on Rasayana Chikitsa (rejuvenation therapy) to enhance longevity, boost immunity, and improve mental and physical vitality.

- Benefits: Enhanced energy levels, better sleep, improved skin health, and mental calmness.

DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS (INVESTIGATION PHASE):

- What are your current dietary and sleep habits?
