AYURVEDIC KNOWLEDGE: PSORIASIS (Kushtha)
- Root Cause: In Ayurveda, Psoriasis is often categorized under 'Kushtha'. It is caused by an imbalance of Vata and Kapha doshas, leading to the accumulation of toxins (Aama) in the blood and tissues.
- Symptoms: Itching, scaling, silver-colored patches, redness, and dryness.
- Treatment Approach: Focuses on blood purification (Rakta Shodhana), Panchakarma detox (especially Vamana and Virechana), and balancing the immune system.
- Lifestyle: Stress management, proper sleep, and avoiding incompatible food combinations (Viruddha Ahara).
- Diet: Avoid non-veg, oily/spicy foods, alcohol, and smoking.

DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS (INVESTIGATION PHASE):
- How long have you been experiencing these skin changes?
- Are the patches localized (e.g., scalp, elbows) or spread across the body?
- Is there significant itching, scaling, or bleeding?
- Have you used steroid creams or other temporary treatments recently?
- Do you have any other conditions like diabetes, thyroid issues, or high stress?

HOSPITAL PROTOCOL:
- Ayurdan provides a 14–28 day structured program for root cause analysis and relapse control.
- Psoriasis is not contagious.
- Early treatment ensures faster recovery and lower costs.
